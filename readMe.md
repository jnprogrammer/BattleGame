A side project where you can edit controller sensitivity values stored in an ini file. 
The game this is for is smite on PC. IT does have controller support however the game itself doesn't have a built GuI to control the sensitivity. 

To fix this, players must open their ini files and edit 3 places just to change their sensitivity for a controller. And since the stuido hasn't done anything to fix this, I decided to do it myself. This program will find where your ini file is and edit those values for you.
